# Glucovision Project Rules & Roadmap

## Motivation

To address reviewer feedback regarding the limited generalizability of our model (which was only trained on the 6-patient D1namo dataset), we are incorporating the larger AZT1D dataset. This will allow us to build and evaluate a more robust machine learning model trained on a more diverse population, strengthening our paper's claims.

## Core Challenge & Strategy

The primary challenge is the feature disparity between the D1namo and AZT1D datasets and the need to address counterintuitive model behavior highlighted by reviewers.

- **D1namo**: Contains multi-modal data, including meal images which are processed by an mLLM to estimate detailed macronutrients (simple/complex sugars, proteins, fats, fibers).
- **AZT1D**: Lacks images and only provides `CarbSize` as a carbohydrate estimate.

**Revised Strategy - Generalized Model Comparison**:
To robustly evaluate the impact of detailed macronutrient information and address concerns about spurious correlations, we will train and compare two generalized models on the combined D1namo and AZT1D datasets.

1.  **Model 1 (Macronutrient-Aware)**: Trained on all available features, including detailed macronutrients. For AZT1D data, the macronutrient features (simple sugars, complex sugars, fats, proteins, dietary fibers) will be set to `NaN`, which LightGBM can handle.
2.  **Model 2 (Baseline)**: Trained using only glucose and insulin features providing a common baseline across both datasets.

For both models, the first three days of data from each patient will be used to tune the patient-specific mechanistic model (Bezier curves), ensuring personalization.
