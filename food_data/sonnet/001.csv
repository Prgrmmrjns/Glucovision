Explanation: The image shows a bowl of what appears to be chopped lettuce or cabbage, likely a simple salad. There's a coin visible above the bowl, which helps estimate the size. Given the leafy nature of the dish, it's very low in simple and complex sugars, with minimal protein and fat. The majority of the content is dietary fiber from the vegetables. The weight is estimated based on the bowl size relative to the coin. This type of salad is very low in calories and high in fiber, making it a nutrient-dense but low-energy food. The estimates are conservative due to the limited ingredients visible and the nature of leafy greens being mostly water and fiber."

- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The meal consists of what appears to be tuna salad with some vegetables, a boiled egg, cheese, and whole wheat bread. Using the Swiss Franc coin (visible in the image) as a reference for scale:

The tuna salad mixture is the main protein source, likely containing around 20g of protein. The egg adds about 6g of protein and 5g of fat. The cheese slice contributes additional protein and fat.

The whole wheat bread slices provide most of the complex carbohydrates and some dietary fiber. There's minimal simple sugar visible, possibly a small amount in the tuna salad dressing.

The vegetables mixed in the tuna salad (possibly celery or pickles) contribute a small amount of dietary fiber.

The overall portion size appears moderate, hence the estimated total weight of 300g. The meal is balanced, with a good proportion of protein, complex carbohydrates, and some healthy fats, making it a nutritious option with relatively low simple sugar content."

Explanation: The image shows a small pat of butter on a mostly empty plate. There's a fork visible and the plate has a decorative red and gold rim. A Swiss Franc coin is partially visible at the edge of the image, which helps estimate the size of the butter pat. 

The butter appears to be about the size of a standard restaurant serving, which is typically around 5 grams. Butter is almost entirely fat, with negligible amounts of other nutrients. It contains no sugars, complex carbohydrates, protein, or dietary fiber. 

The plate shows signs of having held food previously (there are some small food particles or stains visible), but the butter seems to be the only substantial item remaining. Without seeing the full meal, it's not possible to estimate nutritional content beyond this small amount of fat from the butter."

- Simple sugars (g): 15
- Complex sugars (g): 25
- Proteins (g): 8
- Fats (g): 12
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 250

Explanation: The meal consists of a yogurt cup (likely lemon-flavored), a piece of brown bread or cake, a small avocado, an espresso, and what appears to be a Swiss Franc coin for scale. The yogurt likely contributes most of the simple sugars and some protein. The bread/cake provides complex carbs and some fiber. The avocado is the main source of healthy fats and adds fiber. The espresso adds minimal nutritional value but some caffeine. 

Using the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, the portion sizes appear relatively small. The yogurt cup seems to be around 125g, the bread/cake slice about 50g, and the avocado roughly 75g. The espresso is a standard shot size.

This meal is relatively balanced but on the smaller side, which is reflected in the moderate estimates for each nutrient category. The presence of the avocado boosts the fat content, while the yogurt and bread provide a mix of simple and complex carbohydrates. The protein content is modest, mainly from the yogurt and small amounts in the other components."

Explanation: The meal consists of a tomato salad, slices of cheese, and bread. Using the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the plate to be about 20-22 cm in diameter. The tomato salad appears to be the main component, providing most of the simple sugars and dietary fiber. The bread contributes to complex sugars, while the cheese is the primary source of protein and fat. The bread slices look to be about 30-40g each. The tomato salad might be around 150-200g, and the cheese slices about 30-40g total. There's minimal simple sugar, mostly from the tomatoes. The complex sugars come primarily from the bread. Proteins are mainly from the cheese, with some contribution from the bread. Fats are mostly from the cheese. Dietary fibers are from the tomatoes and bread. The total weight considers all components, including the visible utensils. This meal appears to be a balanced, moderate-sized lunch or light dinner."

Explanation: The image shows a plate of chopped tomatoes and possibly some other vegetables or fruits. Using the visible 1 Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the plate to be about 15-20 cm in diameter. The serving appears to be primarily fresh tomatoes with some yellow pieces that could be bell peppers or possibly mango. Tomatoes are low in calories and contain mostly water, with small amounts of simple sugars, fiber, and very little protein or fat. The yellow pieces, if bell peppers, would have a similar nutritional profile. If they're mango, they would contribute slightly more to the simple sugar content. The total weight is estimated based on the apparent volume of chopped vegetables on the plate. This meal is primarily composed of fresh vegetables/fruits, making it high in water content, moderate in fiber, low in sugars, and very low in proteins and fats."

- Explanation: The image shows two pieces of white bread cut into heart shapes on a red background. White bread is primarily composed of complex carbohydrates (starches). There's a 1 Swiss Franc coin visible for scale, which helps estimate the size and weight of the bread pieces. White bread typically contains minimal simple sugars, fats, proteins, and dietary fiber. The estimates are based on standard nutritional content of white bread, adjusted for the small portion size visible. The heart shapes suggest these might be decorative or part of a special meal, but don't significantly alter the nutritional content. The total weight is estimated based on the apparent size of the bread pieces compared to the coin."
7,008.jpg,Lettuce of tomatoes and carrots salad with olive oil,130,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:03 12:37:00,3,10,5,4,8,150,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 3
- Complex sugars (g): 10
- Proteins (g): 5
- Fats (g): 4
- Dietary fibers (g): 8
- Weight (g): 150

Explanation: The image shows two small salad portions. The left plate contains mixed greens with some shredded carrots, while the right plate has a darker leafy salad with cherry tomatoes. There's no visible coin for precise scale, but based on typical restaurant salad serving sizes, I've estimated the total weight.

The meals are primarily composed of vegetables, which are high in dietary fiber and low in simple sugars. The complex sugars come mainly from the vegetables. Proteins and fats are estimated to be relatively low, as there are no visible protein sources like meat or nuts, nor high-fat components like cheese or oily dressings.

The majority of the weight comes from the water content in the vegetables. The dietary fiber content is significant due to the leafy greens and other vegetables. Simple sugars are minimal, possibly coming from the tomatoes and carrots.

This meal appears to be a light, nutrient-dense option with a focus on vegetables, making it high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber while being low in calories and macronutrients like proteins and fats."

- Simple sugars (g): 1
- Complex sugars (g): 30
- Proteins (g): 3
- Fats (g): 1
- Dietary fibers (g): 2
- Weight (g): 50

Explanation: The image shows a small portion of what appears to be toasted bread or a small sandwich on a white plate with a coral-colored napkin. There's no Swiss Franc coin visible for precise scale reference, so I'm making estimates based on the typical size of a bread slice or small sandwich.

The bread, likely made from refined flour, contributes most of the complex sugars. There's no visible spread or filling, so the protein, fat, and simple sugar content is estimated to be quite low. The bread crust may provide a small amount of dietary fiber.

The portion size appears small, hence the relatively low total weight estimate. Without seeing any condiments, spreads, or fillings, and considering only the visible bread, the nutritional content is primarily carbohydrates from the bread itself.

These estimates are approximate given the limited view and information available in the image. A more accurate assessment would require additional details about the bread type and any hidden ingredients."

Explanation: The image shows a strawberry smoothie or yogurt drink in a glass, garnished with fresh strawberries. There's a 1 Swiss Franc coin visible for scale, which helps in estimating the portion size. The drink appears to be primarily fruit-based, likely containing strawberries and possibly other berries, which contributes to its high simple sugar content. The pink color and creamy texture suggest the presence of yogurt or milk, adding some protein and fat. The fresh strawberries on top provide dietary fiber. 

The portion size seems to be around 250-300ml based on the glass size compared to the coin. The presence of whole fruits contributes to the fiber content. The smoothie/yogurt base accounts for the majority of the weight, with added sugars likely present to enhance sweetness. The decorative sauce on the plate is not included in the nutritional estimation as it appears to be primarily for presentation.

This estimation assumes the drink is made with a mix of whole fruits, yogurt or milk, and possibly some added sugar, which is common in commercial smoothie preparations. The nutritional content could vary based on the exact recipe and ingredients used."

- Explanation: The image shows a package of what appears to be vitamin C or ascorbic acid tablets. There are several white, round tablets visible, with some outside the package on a wooden surface. The package has orange imagery, likely indicating a citrus flavor. Vitamin C tablets typically contain mostly simple sugars as fillers and binders, with the active ingredient being ascorbic acid. They generally don't contain significant amounts of complex sugars, proteins, fats, or dietary fibers. The total weight is estimated based on the typical size of such tablets, which are usually around 1-2 grams each. Without a coin for scale, precise measurements are challenging, but these tablets appear to be standard size for dietary supplements. The nutritional content is minimal, as these are primarily intended as a vitamin supplement rather than a food source."
12,013.jpg,lemon yogurt,184,Balance,Medium quality,2014:10:04 09:29:58,12,3,5,3,0,180,"Based on the image provided, here's my nutritional estimate for the lemon yogurt:

- Simple sugars (g): 12
- Complex sugars (g): 3
- Proteins (g): 5
- Fats (g): 3
- Dietary fibers (g): 0
- Weight (g): 180

Explanation: The image shows a container of lemon-flavored yogurt. Yogurt typically contains some natural sugars from milk (lactose) and possibly added sugars for flavor. The lemon flavor might contribute to slightly higher simple sugar content. Proteins are present in yogurt from milk, but the amount is moderate. Fats are likely low to moderate, depending on whether it's a low-fat or full-fat yogurt. Yogurt generally doesn't contain significant dietary fiber.

The Swiss Franc coin visible in the image helps estimate the size of the yogurt container. Based on this, it appears to be a standard single-serving yogurt, typically around 150-200g. I've estimated 180g as the total weight.

The ""BIO"" label suggests it's an organic product, which doesn't necessarily affect the macronutrient content but indicates the ingredients are organically sourced.

These estimates are approximate given the limited information visible on the package and the nature of the product. The actual nutritional content may vary depending on the specific recipe and brand."

Explanation: The image shows a bottle of Gatorade sports drink. Gatorade is primarily composed of water, simple sugars, and electrolytes. It doesn't contain significant amounts of complex sugars, proteins, fats, or dietary fibers. A typical 20 oz (591 ml) bottle of Gatorade contains about 36 grams of sugar, which are all simple sugars. The bottle in the image appears to be a standard size, so I've estimated the weight at about 600 grams (accounting for the liquid and the bottle itself). The coin visible in the image helps confirm the scale, though it's not necessary for this particular estimation since the bottle is a recognizable standard size. It's important to note that sports drinks like Gatorade are designed for quick energy during intense physical activity and are not intended as a regular beverage due to their high sugar content."

- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The meal consists of a large bowl of leafy green salad (likely lettuce or similar greens), a plate with what appears to be sliced ham or cold cuts, a small piece of cheese, and two slices of bread. There's also a small jar visible, which might contain dressing or condiments. 

The 1 Swiss Franc coin is visible in the image, providing a good scale reference. Using this, we can estimate the portion sizes more accurately.

The salad provides most of the dietary fiber and some complex carbohydrates. The bread contributes to complex carbohydrates. The ham or cold cuts are the main source of protein and also contribute to the fat content. The cheese adds both protein and fat. There are minimal simple sugars visible, possibly a small amount in the dressing if present.

The total weight is estimated considering the substantial bowl of salad, the meat and cheese servings, and the bread slices. The nutritional breakdown reflects a meal that's relatively balanced, with a good amount of protein, moderate carbohydrates (mostly complex), and a fair amount of fiber from the vegetables. The fat content is moderate, coming primarily from the meat and cheese."

Explanation: The meal consists of a few slices of what appears to be whole grain bread, two halves of a golden kiwi fruit, a cup of coffee or tea, and what looks like a yogurt container. There's also a bottle that might contain juice or another beverage. Using the Swiss Franc coin as a reference (which is visible in the image), I estimated the portion sizes.

The bread provides the bulk of the complex sugars and some protein. The kiwi contributes to simple sugars and dietary fiber. The yogurt, if that's what the container holds, would add some protein, fats, and potentially some simple sugars depending on if it's flavored. The beverage in the cup and bottle could add to the simple sugar content, but it's hard to determine without knowing exactly what they are.

The total weight estimate takes into account the visible food items and assumes average portion sizes for the beverages. The nutritional breakdown is a rough estimate based on typical values for these foods, but could vary depending on specific ingredients and preparation methods."
17,018.jpg,Apple and raisinsugar tablets,374,Unbalance,Medium quality,2014:10:05 09:56:05,30,20,1,0,4,200,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 30
- Complex sugars (g): 20
- Proteins (g): 1
- Fats (g): 0
- Dietary fibers (g): 4
- Weight (g): 200

Explanation: The image shows a medium-sized apple, a small packet of what appears to be grape sugar or a similar product, and three small white tablets (likely vitamins or supplements). The 1 Swiss Franc coin is visible, helping to gauge the size of the items.

The apple, which constitutes the bulk of the weight, provides most of the nutrients. Apples contain primarily simple sugars (fructose) and some complex carbohydrates, along with dietary fiber. The grape sugar packet would contribute additional simple sugars.

The apple likely weighs around 180-190g based on its size relative to the coin. The sugar packet and tablets would add a small amount to the total weight. 

The simple sugars estimate includes both the natural sugars from the apple and the added sugars from the packet. Complex sugars and dietary fibers come primarily from the apple. Protein and fat content in this meal is minimal, mainly trace amounts from the apple.

The tablets are not factored into the nutritional estimates as they are likely supplements rather than food. This meal is primarily carbohydrate-based with a moderate amount of natural fruit sugars and fiber."

- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The meal consists of pasta (likely macaroni), what appears to be chicken pieces, and celery sticks. Using the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the plate to be about 20-22 cm in diameter. 

The pasta, which takes up about a third of the plate, contributes most of the complex sugars and some protein. The chicken pieces provide the bulk of the protein and some fat. The celery sticks offer minimal calories but contribute to the fiber content.

There are likely very few simple sugars in this meal, as none of the visible components are typically high in simple sugars. The complex sugars come primarily from the pasta. The protein estimate factors in both the pasta and the chicken. The fat content is relatively low, mainly coming from the chicken and any sauce or dressing used in preparation. The dietary fiber comes from the celery and, to a lesser extent, the pasta.

The total weight estimate of 300g takes into account the visible portions and the typical weight of a meal of this size. This is a balanced meal with a good mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and vegetables, though it's relatively low in fats and simple sugars."

- Weight (g): 40

Explanation: The image shows several small, round snacks that appear to be homemade energy balls or protein bites. They seem to be made primarily of oats (providing complex carbs) with visible dark spots that are likely raisins or other dried fruit (contributing simple sugars and some fiber). The binding agent is probably nut butter or ground nuts (providing fats and some protein).

The 1 Swiss Franc coin in the image helps estimate the size of each ball to be roughly 2-3 cm in diameter. Based on this, I estimate the total weight of all the balls shown to be around 40 grams.

The snacks are likely relatively low in simple sugars, as they appear homemade without added refined sugars. The oats contribute the bulk of the complex carbohydrates. The fat content is moderate, coming from nuts or nut butter. Protein is present but not a major component. Dietary fiber is limited but present from the oats and dried fruit.

This estimate assumes a typical recipe for this type of snack and takes into account the visible ingredients and texture. The actual nutritional content could vary based on the specific recipe used."

- Simple sugars (g): 15
- Complex sugars (g): 40
- Proteins (g): 8
- Fats (g): 3
- Dietary fibers (g): 4
- Weight (g): 180

Explanation: The meal consists of what appears to be two slices of whole grain bread, a yogurt container (likely Passion fruit flavor), and a bottle of what seems to be fruit juice. Using the Swiss Franc coin as a reference, I estimate the bread slices to be about 60g each. The yogurt container looks to be around 125g, and I assume a small amount of juice (perhaps 100ml or 100g).

The whole grain bread provides most of the complex sugars and some fiber. The yogurt likely contains both simple and complex sugars, as well as proteins. The fruit juice would contribute mainly simple sugars. There's minimal fat in this meal, mostly from the bread and potentially the yogurt if it's not fat-free.

The fiber content is moderate due to the whole grain bread. Protein comes primarily from the bread and yogurt. The overall meal is relatively light and appears to be a simple breakfast or snack. The presence of whole grains and yogurt suggests an attempt at a somewhat balanced, though carbohydrate-heavy, meal."

Explanation: The image shows a jar of honey (Blütenhonig) and what appears to be a small container of yogurt with lemon flavor. There's no Swiss Franc coin visible for precise scale, but I'll estimate based on typical sizes of these products.

The honey jar likely contains about 250g of honey, which is almost entirely simple sugars. However, it's not clear if we're meant to consider the full jar or just a serving. I've estimated for about 2-3 tablespoons (around 40g) of honey consumption.

The yogurt container appears to be around 150g based on standard sizes. It would contribute some protein, a small amount of fat, and potentially a gram or two of fiber from the lemon. Yogurt also contains some natural sugars (lactose), which I've included in the simple sugar estimate.

There's a spoon in the image, suggesting these items might be combined for consumption. The total weight estimate of 280g accounts for both the estimated honey serving and the yogurt.

This meal is predominantly simple sugars from the honey, with some additional nutrients from the yogurt. The nutritional profile is heavily skewed towards carbohydrates, particularly simple sugars, with minimal complex carbs, proteins, fats, or fibers."

- Simple sugars (g): 20
- Complex sugars (g): 35
- Proteins (g): 18
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The meal consists of a packaged roast beef sandwich, a pastry item (possibly a Danish or similar sweet pastry), and a Kägi chocolate wafer bar. Using the visible 1 Swiss Franc coin as a reference, I've estimated the sizes and weights of these items.

The sandwich contributes most of the complex sugars (from bread) and proteins (from beef). The pastry and chocolate wafer bar are the main sources of simple sugars and fats. The sandwich likely contains some vegetables, accounting for the small amount of dietary fiber.

The Kägi bar is a significant source of simple sugars and fats. The pastry also adds to both simple and complex sugar content, as well as fats.

The total weight estimate of 300g takes into account the visible size of the items compared to the coin, and the typical weights of similar packaged foods.

This meal is relatively high in carbohydrates and fats, with a moderate amount of protein. It's not particularly high in dietary fiber. The presence of processed foods like the chocolate wafer and pastry increases the simple sugar content significantly."
