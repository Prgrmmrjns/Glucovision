0,001.jpg,Pasta with champignons and parmesan cheesse,637.0,Balance,Good quality,2014:10:01 12:21:59,2,50,15,8,3,300,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 2
- Complex sugars (g): 50
- Proteins (g): 15
- Fats (g): 8
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The image shows a plate of pasta with what appears to be a cream-based sauce and a generous sprinkle of grated cheese on top. Using the Swiss Franc coin (diameter 23.22 mm) as a reference, I estimate the portion size to be around 300 grams total.

The pasta forms the bulk of the meal, contributing significantly to the complex sugars (carbohydrates). The cream sauce and cheese provide most of the fat and protein content. There's likely a small amount of simple sugars from any ingredients in the sauce.

The dietary fiber content is relatively low, as refined pasta doesn't contain much fiber, and there are no visible vegetables. The protein estimate comes from the cheese and any potential meat in the sauce, though it's not clearly visible.

This meal is primarily a source of complex carbohydrates from the pasta, with moderate amounts of protein and fat from the sauce and cheese. The nutritional profile could be improved by adding vegetables for more fiber and nutrients."
1,002.jpg,Salad with olive oil ,88.0,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:01 12:22:06,2,45,10,3,4,280,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 2
- Complex sugars (g): 45
- Proteins (g): 10
- Fats (g): 3
- Dietary fibers (g): 4
- Weight (g): 280

Explanation: The image shows a meal consisting of pasta and a mixed salad. The pasta, visible in the top left corner, contributes significantly to the complex sugars. It appears to be a modest portion of plain pasta, likely around 150-200g cooked weight. The salad contains various leafy greens, including what looks like red cabbage and lettuce, providing dietary fiber. There's no visible protein source like meat or beans, so the protein estimate is primarily from the pasta and small amounts in the vegetables. The fat content is likely low as there's no visible oil or high-fat components. The simple sugar content is minimal, coming only from the vegetables. The overall meal appears light and plant-based. No Swiss Franc coin is visible for precise scaling, so estimates are based on typical portion sizes and plate dimensions. The total weight estimate includes both the pasta and salad components."
2,003.jpg,Pasta with champignons and parmesan cheesse,637.0,Balance,Good quality,2014:10:01 12:22:15,3,65,25,15,2,350,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 3
- Complex sugars (g): 65
- Proteins (g): 25
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 2
- Weight (g): 350

Explanation: The image shows a plate of pasta with what appears to be a cream or cheese-based sauce and some kind of meat or seafood topping. Using the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the portion size to be moderate, around 350g total weight.

The pasta forms the bulk of the meal, contributing significantly to complex sugars (carbohydrates). The sauce and topping provide most of the protein and fat content. There's likely minimal simple sugar, mainly from any natural sugars in the sauce ingredients. The fiber content is low, as refined pasta doesn't contain much fiber, and there are no visible vegetables.

The protein estimate accounts for both the pasta and the topping. The fat content is moderate, considering the creamy sauce. The simple sugar content is kept low as there's no visible sweet component to the dish.

This analysis is an estimate based on visual assessment and the coin for scale, but without precise measurements or knowledge of all ingredients, these figures are approximate."
3,005.jpg,Pumpkin soup,93.0,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:01 12:22:31,0,2,1,1,0,250,"Based on the image provided, here's my nutritional estimate:

- Simple sugars (g): 0
- Complex sugars (g): 2
- Proteins (g): 1
- Fats (g): 1
- Dietary fibers (g): 0
- Weight (g): 250

Explanation: The image shows a white bowl containing what appears to be a light-colored, creamy soup or broth. There's a Swiss Franc coin held near the bowl for scale. Given the liquid nature of the contents, it's likely low in most nutrients except for possibly some fats from cream if it's a cream-based soup. The portion size appears to be around 250ml (or grams for a liquid) based on the coin's size. Without visible solid ingredients, I've estimated very low amounts of complex sugars and proteins that might come from a small amount of flour for thickening or dissolved meat proteins. The dietary fiber content is likely negligible. This appears to be a very light soup or broth, which typically wouldn't contribute significantly to daily nutrient intake beyond hydration and possibly some minerals not quantified here."
4,006.jpg,Sausages with salad and potatoes chips,1059.0,Unbalance,Medium quality,2014:10:01 21:20:45,8,30,25,15,12,450,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 8
- Complex sugars (g): 30
- Proteins (g): 25
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 12
- Weight (g): 450

Explanation: The meal consists of a vegetable stew in a bowl, sliced potatoes or possibly cheese, cooked carrots, green salad, and what appear to be sausages on a plate. There's no visible Swiss Franc coin for precise scale, so estimates are based on typical portion sizes.

The stew likely contains vegetables and possibly some meat, contributing to proteins and complex carbs. The sliced item (potato or cheese) adds to complex carbs if potato, or fats and proteins if cheese. Carrots provide some simple sugars and fiber. The sausages are a significant source of protein and fat. The salad contributes to the fiber content.

There seems to be minimal added simple sugars, with most coming naturally from vegetables. Complex carbs come from vegetables and potentially the sliced item. Proteins are mainly from the sausages and possibly the stew. Fats are primarily from the sausages. Dietary fibers are present in the vegetables and salad.

The total weight estimate considers all components, assuming average portion sizes for a single meal. This meal appears to be relatively balanced, with a good mix of vegetables and proteins, though somewhat high in fats due to the sausages."
5,007.jpg,"Soup,Salmon pastry,grilled vegestables, boiled potatoes and pumpkin pay",1678.0,Unbalance,Medium quality,2014:10:02 13:05:33,15,85,20,25,8,450,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 15
- Complex sugars (g): 85
- Proteins (g): 20
- Fats (g): 25
- Dietary fibers (g): 8
- Weight (g): 450

Explanation: The meal consists of a soup (likely potato-based), boiled potatoes, cooked vegetables (possibly zucchini and greens), a piece of bread, and a slice of cake. There's also a 1 Swiss Franc coin visible for scale. 

The soup and potatoes contribute significantly to the complex sugars. The vegetables and bread add fiber. The cake slice provides simple sugars. Proteins likely come from the vegetables and potentially the soup if it contains any meat or dairy. Fats are estimated from potential butter on the potatoes, oil used in cooking, and the cake.

The presence of the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) helps estimate portion sizes more accurately. The main plate appears to hold about 250-300g of food, the soup bowl around 200g, and the cake slice approximately 50g. 

This meal seems relatively balanced, with a good mix of vegetables and starches, though it's somewhat high in carbohydrates. The dessert adds to the simple sugar content, but overall, it's a modest portion."
7,011.jpg,Spaguetti with rag√ªot and bolognese sauce,687.0,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:02 20:56:36,5,70,30,20,8,400,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 5
- Complex sugars (g): 70
- Proteins (g): 30
- Fats (g): 20
- Dietary fibers (g): 8
- Weight (g): 400

Explanation: The image shows a pasta dish with what appears to be a meat sauce, garnished with basil leaves. Using the visible 1 Swiss Franc coin for scale, I estimate this to be a medium-sized portion. The pasta provides the bulk of complex carbohydrates. The meat sauce contributes proteins and fats, while also adding some simple sugars from the tomatoes. The basil and any vegetables in the sauce provide a small amount of dietary fiber. The portion size, estimated using the coin as reference, suggests a total weight of around 400g. The predominance of pasta indicates a high complex sugar content, while the meat sauce provides a good amount of protein and moderate fat. The relatively small amount of visible vegetables suggests a modest fiber content. Simple sugars are likely low, mainly coming from the tomato-based sauce."
8,012.jpg,Bread and natural yogurt,224.0,Balance,Medium quality,2014:10:03 10:07:46,5,30,8,10,2,200,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 5
- Complex sugars (g): 30
- Proteins (g): 8
- Fats (g): 10
- Dietary fibers (g): 2
- Weight (g): 200

Explanation: The image shows a small meal consisting of a piece of bread, what appears to be a small container of yogurt or cream, and possibly a half of a grapefruit or similar citrus fruit. There's no Swiss Franc coin visible for precise scale, but I'll estimate based on typical serving sizes.

The bread slice provides most of the complex sugars and some protein. The yogurt/cream contributes to the protein and fat content. If the fruit is indeed grapefruit, it adds a small amount of simple sugars and dietary fiber.

The yogurt container looks to be about 125-150g, the bread slice around 30-40g, and the fruit half (if grapefruit) about 100g. This gives us a rough total weight estimate.

The estimates are conservative due to the small portion sizes visible. The meal appears to be relatively low in simple sugars unless the yogurt is sweetened, which isn't clear from the image. The lack of visible vegetables or whole grains results in a low estimate for dietary fiber."
9,013.jpg,Rago√ªt beef and frites natural potatoes ,476.0,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:03 14:07:24,2,45,30,20,3,300,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 2
- Complex sugars (g): 45
- Proteins (g): 30
- Fats (g): 20
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The meal consists of what appears to be ground meat (likely beef) and a side of french fries. There's no visible 1 Swiss Franc coin for precise scale reference, so I'm making estimates based on the typical portion sizes and the plate's apparent size.

The ground meat is high in protein and fat, with little to no carbohydrates. I've estimated about 150g of meat, which accounts for most of the protein and fat content.

The french fries contribute to the complex sugars (starch) and fats. They also add a small amount of dietary fiber from the potato skin. I've estimated about 100-120g of fries.

There are minimal simple sugars in this meal, as neither component typically contains added sugars. The small amount estimated comes from any natural sugars in the potatoes.

The dietary fiber content is low, coming primarily from the potato skins of the fries.

The total weight estimate of 300g takes into account both the meat and fries portions.

This meal is relatively high in protein and complex carbohydrates, with a moderate amount of fat, typical of a meat and potatoes style dish."
10,014.jpg,Batata,86.0,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:03 20:36:17,2,30,3,1,4,150,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Fats (g): 1
- Dietary fibers (g): 4
- Weight (g): 150

Explanation: The image shows a plate with what appears to be sliced sweet potato or yam. Sweet potatoes are primarily composed of complex carbohydrates, with some dietary fiber. They contain very little simple sugar, protein, or fat. The portion size seems moderate, likely around 150g total weight. There's no Swiss Franc coin visible for precise scale, so I've made estimates based on the plate size and utensils. The sweet potato's orange color indicates it's rich in beta-carotene, which contributes to its fiber content. The small amount of simple sugars comes from the natural sugars in the sweet potato. The estimates are conservative due to the lack of precise sizing information, but reflect the typical nutritional profile of a sweet potato serving."

Explanation: The image shows a bowl of what appears to be cereal or perhaps some kind of dessert in a creamy milk or sauce. There are visible round cereal pieces or possibly small marshmallows floating in the liquid. A Swiss Franc coin is visible at the edge of the image, providing a scale reference.

The dish seems to be primarily composed of milk or a creamy sauce, which contributes to both the simple sugars (lactose) and fats. The cereal or marshmallow pieces would add to the simple and complex sugar content. There's likely some protein from the milk or cream, but not a high amount.

The portion size appears to be moderate, estimated at around 300g total weight based on the coin size reference. The dietary fiber content is estimated to be low, as there are no visible fruits, vegetables, or whole grains.

This meal would likely have a significant impact on blood sugar levels due to its high simple sugar content and lack of fiber to slow digestion. The fat content would somewhat moderate the blood sugar spike, but overall this appears to be a carbohydrate-heavy dish with moderate fat and low protein and fiber."

Explanation: The image shows a small round bread roll or bun, likely a dinner roll or small bread loaf. Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the bread to be about 7-8 cm in diameter. 

The bread appears to be a simple white or wheat bread, which is primarily composed of complex carbohydrates (starches). It likely has a small amount of protein from the flour, and minimal fats unless it was enriched during baking. The crust provides a small amount of dietary fiber.

The estimates are relatively low across all categories due to the small size of the bread roll. The majority of its weight and nutritional content comes from the complex carbohydrates in the flour. There are likely trace amounts of simple sugars from the fermentation process, but not significant amounts.

The total weight estimate of 80g is based on the apparent density of the bread and its size relative to the coin. This is a rough estimate for a small, dense bread roll of this size."

Explanation: The meal consists of a chicken leg, a portion of spaghetti, and what appears to be a half of a baked sweet potato. Using the visible parts of the plate and table as reference (no coin is present), I've estimated the portion sizes. The spaghetti contributes most of the complex sugars. The chicken leg provides most of the protein and some fat. The sweet potato adds some complex sugars and a small amount of fiber. There are minimal simple sugars in this meal, mostly from the natural sugars in the sweet potato. The total weight estimate considers all components, including any sauce or seasoning on the chicken. This meal appears to be a balanced combination of protein, carbohydrates, and a small amount of healthy fats, with moderate fiber content primarily from the sweet potato skin."

Explanation: The image shows a plate with three slices of pizza, each with different toppings. There's no visible Swiss Franc coin for precise scaling, so estimates are based on typical pizza slice sizes and toppings.

The pizza appears to be a thin-crust variety, which contributes to the complex sugars estimate. The cheese and various toppings (including what looks like vegetables on one slice) provide the protein and fat content. The vegetable toppings also contribute a small amount of dietary fiber.

The simple sugars are estimated to be relatively low as there's no visible sweet sauce or dessert-like toppings. The complex sugars come primarily from the pizza crust. Proteins are derived from the cheese and any meat toppings. Fats are present in the cheese and any oil used in preparation.

The total weight is estimated based on the appearance of three medium-sized, thin-crust pizza slices. Without a coin for scale, these estimates are approximate and could vary based on the actual size of the plate and pizza slices."

Explanation: The image shows a small portion of what appears to be breakfast cereal, likely Cheerios or a similar oat-based cereal, on a black plate. There's no Swiss Franc coin visible for precise scale, but based on the typical size of cereal pieces and the plate, I've estimated the portion size.

The cereal is primarily composed of complex carbohydrates from the oats, which accounts for the majority of its weight. There's a small amount of protein typical in cereals, and minimal fat content. The simple sugars estimate is low as there's no visible sugar coating, though some cereals have a small amount added. Dietary fiber is present but in a small amount due to the small portion size.

The total weight estimate of 30g represents a small serving of dry cereal. This is a very light meal or snack, not a full portion one would typically eat for breakfast. The nutritional estimates are conservative due to the small amount visible, and actual values could be higher if this is part of a larger serving not fully shown in the image."
