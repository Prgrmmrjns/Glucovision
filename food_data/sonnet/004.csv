001.jpg,Lettuce with carrots and dressing,161,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:01 12:25:47,3,15,8,5,6,200,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 3
- Complex sugars (g): 15
- Proteins (g): 8
- Fats (g): 5
- Dietary fibers (g): 6
- Weight (g): 200

Explanation: The meal appears to be a light salad with mixed greens, shredded carrots, and what looks like beetroot. There's also a small piece of bread. Using the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the plate to be about 20-25 cm in diameter. 

The salad greens and vegetables contribute most of the dietary fiber and some complex carbohydrates. The shredded carrots provide a small amount of simple sugars. The bread slice accounts for most of the complex carbohydrates. 

Proteins are likely minimal, possibly coming from a light dressing and small amounts in the vegetables and bread. Fats are estimated to be low, mainly from the dressing.

The overall meal appears quite light and vegetable-focused, hence the relatively low total weight estimate. The nutritional profile reflects a health-conscious, plant-based meal with an emphasis on vegetables and minimal processed ingredients."

- Simple sugars (g): 2
- Complex sugars (g): 30
- Proteins (g): 25
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 300
- Explanation: The meal consists of a piece of salmon, roasted potatoes, and a sauce that appears to be hollandaise. There's also a small garnish of microgreens and cherry tomatoes. The salmon provides most of the protein and healthy fats. The potatoes contribute the bulk of the complex carbohydrates. The sauce adds to the fat content. There are minimal simple sugars, mainly from the small amount of vegetables. Dietary fiber is low, coming primarily from the potatoes and small vegetable garnish. The portion size appears moderate, with the plate likely around 20-25 cm in diameter. No Swiss Franc coin is visible for precise scaling, but based on typical restaurant portion sizes, I've estimated the total weight. The cooking method (likely roasted for potatoes, grilled or pan-seared for salmon) influences the final nutritional content, particularly fat content."
003.jpg,Pasta with lettuce and pepper,289,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:02 13:47:52,5,45,15,8,10,300,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 5
- Complex sugars (g): 45
- Proteins (g): 15
- Fats (g): 8
- Dietary fibers (g): 10
- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The image shows a plate of what appears to be a stir-fry or noodle dish with vegetables. There's a good mix of noodles (likely providing complex carbohydrates) and various vegetables (providing fiber and some proteins). The presence of noodles contributes to the bulk of complex sugars. The vegetables (including what looks like broccoli, bell peppers, and possibly some leafy greens) account for the dietary fiber content. There's likely some protein from the vegetables and possibly some unseen protein source. The fat content is estimated to be relatively low, assuming minimal oil was used in cooking. The simple sugar content is estimated to be low as there are no visible sweet components. The 1 Swiss Franc coin visible in the image helps in estimating the portion size, which appears to be a moderate serving. The total weight is estimated considering the density of the noodles and vegetables. This meal appears to be a balanced, vegetable-rich dish with a good mix of nutrients."
004.jpg,Frites potatoes,146,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:02 20:51:17,2,70,25,15,3,250,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 2
- Complex sugars (g): 70
- Proteins (g): 25
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 250

Explanation: The meal consists of what appears to be a piece of fish or chicken in a light sauce, accompanied by a generous portion of french fries. The protein source provides most of the protein content. The fries contribute significantly to the complex sugars (starch) and fats. There's minimal simple sugar, likely just from the sauce. Dietary fiber is low as there are no visible vegetables or whole grains. The 1 Swiss Franc coin visible in the image helps estimate the portion size, suggesting a moderate meal weight. The bright green plate appears to be about 25-30 cm in diameter based on the coin's known size of 23.22 mm. This reference helps in gauging the quantity of food more accurately, particularly the amount of fries which make up the bulk of the meal's weight and carbohydrate content."
005.jpg,Frites potatoes and frite fish ,599,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:03 14:14:58,5,30,20,15,3,250,"Based on the image and using the visible Swiss Franc coin for scale, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 5
- Complex sugars (g): 30
- Proteins (g): 20
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 250

Explanation: The plate contains what appears to be fried fish or chicken strips and roasted or saut√©ed potatoes. The fish/chicken provides most of the protein and fat content. The potatoes contribute the majority of complex carbohydrates and some dietary fiber. There's likely a small amount of simple sugars from any seasoning or slight caramelization on the potatoes. The portion size seems moderate, with the coin helping to gauge the scale. The lack of visible vegetables or fruits limits the fiber content. The cooking method (likely pan-fried or deep-fried for the fish/chicken) contributes to the fat content. The overall meal is relatively high in protein and complex carbohydrates, moderate in fat, and lower in simple sugars and dietary fiber."
006.jpg,Ham pizza and cooked pizza dough,842,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:03 20:33:41,4,45,18,15,3,250,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 4
- Complex sugars (g): 45
- Proteins (g): 18
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 250

Explanation: The image shows a plate with a slice of pizza and what appears to be a small bread roll or potato. The 1 Swiss Franc coin is visible, helping to gauge the size. The pizza slice seems to be a standard size, likely around 150-180g. It has a cheese and tomato base with some additional toppings that look like ham or bacon. The bread/potato adds about 70-80g.

The pizza crust and the bread/potato contribute most of the complex sugars. Proteins come from the cheese and meat toppings. Fats are primarily from the cheese and any oil in the crust. Simple sugars are low, mainly from the tomato sauce. Dietary fibers are minimal, coming from the small amount of vegetables in the sauce and toppings.

The total weight estimate considers all components. This meal is primarily carbohydrate-based with moderate protein and fat content, typical of a pizza-based meal. The fiber content is relatively low due to the lack of whole grains or substantial vegetable toppings."
007.jpg,Proscuito pizza,864,Unbalance,Medium quality,2014:10:04 12:16:26,8,70,25,18,4,350,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 8
- Complex sugars (g): 70
- Proteins (g): 25
- Fats (g): 18
- Dietary fibers (g): 4
- Weight (g): 350

Explanation: The image shows a Neapolitan-style pizza with prosciutto, tomatoes, and basil. There's no coin visible, but using the plate as a reference, I estimate the pizza to be about 10-11 inches in diameter. The crust provides most of the complex carbohydrates. The tomato sauce and fresh tomatoes contribute some simple sugars and fibers. The prosciutto is the main source of protein and also adds to the fat content. The cheese (likely mozzarella) provides both protein and fat. The basil leaves add minimal fiber. The charred edges of the crust suggest it's wood-fired, which typically results in a lighter pizza. Given these factors, I've estimated the total weight and nutritional breakdown. The simple sugar content is relatively low as there are no sweet toppings, just a small amount from the tomatoes and sauce. The complex carbs from the crust make up the bulk of the carbohydrate content. The protein comes mainly from the prosciutto and cheese, while the fats are from the olive oil, cheese, and prosciutto. Fiber is minimal, coming from the tomatoes and small amount in the crust."
008.jpg,Boiled rice with ham,205,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:04 20:11:45,1,30,15,5,1,150,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 1
- Complex sugars (g): 30
- Proteins (g): 15
- Fats (g): 5
- Dietary fibers (g): 1
- Weight (g): 150

Explanation: The meal consists of what appears to be a slice of ham and a portion of white rice on a plate. Using the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I've estimated the portion sizes. The rice, being a refined grain, contributes most of the complex sugars. The ham provides the bulk of the protein content, with some fat. There's minimal simple sugar or dietary fiber in this meal. The total weight estimate accounts for both the ham and rice portions. The meal is relatively low in fat and simple sugars, moderate in protein, and high in complex carbohydrates from the rice. The lack of vegetables or fruits results in a very low fiber content. This meal would likely have a moderate to high glycemic index due to the white rice, despite the protein from the ham potentially slowing digestion somewhat."
