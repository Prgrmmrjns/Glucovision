001.jpg,Cantaloupe and couscous,375,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:01 11:38:37,15,45,8,3,6,300,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 15
- Complex sugars (g): 45
- Proteins (g): 8
- Fats (g): 3
- Dietary fibers (g): 6
- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The meal consists of what appears to be couscous or quinoa and chunks of cantaloupe melon. Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the plate to be about 20-22 cm in diameter. 

The grain portion (likely couscous) provides most of the complex carbohydrates and some protein. It may have some added fats from preparation, but likely minimal. The cantaloupe contributes to the simple sugars and dietary fiber content.

Couscous is primarily complex carbohydrates with some protein. Cantaloupe is low in calories but high in vitamins and fiber, with natural sugars. The portion sizes appear moderate, with the couscous taking up about 1/3 of the plate and the melon 2/3.

The total weight estimate factors in the density of couscous and the water content of the melon. This meal appears to be a balanced, relatively light option with a good mix of complex carbohydrates and fruit, providing sustained energy and essential nutrients."

Explanation: The meal consists of two slices of whole grain bread, several slices of tomato with herbs and spices, small cubes of what appears to be feta cheese, and a few olives. Using the Swiss Franc coin as a reference (23.22 mm diameter), I estimated the portion sizes.

The bread provides most of the complex sugars and some fiber. Tomatoes contribute to dietary fiber and a small amount of simple sugars. The feta cheese and olives are the main sources of fat and protein. The herbs and spices add negligible weight but boost flavor and potentially some health benefits.

The meal is relatively light and balanced, with a good mix of complex carbohydrates, vegetables, and a moderate amount of fat and protein. It's a Mediterranean-style dish that's generally considered healthy. The portion size appears modest, which is reflected in the total weight estimate."
003.jpg,"Hamburguer, zuchinni and red wine",434,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:01 12:35:42,2,15,30,20,8,300,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 2
- Complex sugars (g): 15
- Proteins (g): 30
- Fats (g): 20
- Dietary fibers (g): 8
- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The meal consists of a meat patty (likely beef) and grilled zucchini slices, accompanied by a glass of red wine. There's a Swiss Franc coin visible for scale. The meat patty provides most of the protein and fat content. Zucchini contributes dietary fiber and some complex carbohydrates. Red wine adds a small amount of simple sugars. 

The meat patty appears to be about 150g, while the zucchini slices might total around 100g. The wine glass contains approximately 150ml of wine. The coin helps estimate the plate size and portion sizes more accurately.

There are minimal simple sugars in this meal, mainly from the wine. Complex carbs are limited, mostly from the vegetables. Protein content is high due to the meat. Fats are moderate, primarily from the meat. Dietary fiber comes from the zucchini. The overall meal is relatively low-carb and high in protein, with a moderate fat content."
004.jpg,Wholegrain bread and milkchocolate,304,Unbalance,Medium quality,2014:10:01 16:24:04,10,30,5,8,3,80,"Based on the image provided, here's my nutritional estimate:

- Simple sugars (g): 10
- Complex sugars (g): 30
- Proteins (g): 5
- Fats (g): 8
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 80

Explanation: The image shows a slice of what appears to be whole wheat bread, a piece of caramel or toffee, and a coin for scale (likely the 1 Swiss Franc coin mentioned). Using the coin's known diameter of 23.22 mm as reference:

The bread slice is roughly 3-4 times the coin's diameter, suggesting it's about 70-90 grams. It's the main source of complex carbohydrates and some fiber. 

The caramel/toffee piece is approximately the size of the coin, likely weighing around 10-15 grams. This contributes most of the simple sugars and fats in the meal.

The bread provides most of the protein and dietary fiber, though in modest amounts given the serving size. The overall meal is relatively small, hence the low total weight estimate.

The estimates are conservative due to the small portion sizes. The lack of fruits, vegetables, or significant protein sources limits the nutritional diversity of this meal."
005.jpg,"wienerschnitzel, potatoes, coliflower, carrots, bread and beer",1691,Unbalance,Medium quality,2014:10:01 21:34:39,5,80,35,25,10,450,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 5
- Complex sugars (g): 80
- Proteins (g): 35
- Fats (g): 25
- Dietary fibers (g): 10
- Weight (g): 450

Explanation: The meal consists of what appears to be a breaded schnitzel or cutlet, french fries, mixed vegetables, and a slice of bread. There's also a glass of beer visible. Using the Swiss Franc coin as a reference (which is visible in the image), I've estimated the portion sizes.

The schnitzel provides most of the protein and a significant portion of the fat. The french fries contribute heavily to the complex sugars (starch) and some fat. The mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, and cauliflower) provide dietary fiber and some complex sugars. The bread slice adds to the complex sugars and provides a small amount of protein and fiber.

The beer contributes to the simple sugars estimate, though it's relatively low. The breading on the schnitzel and the french fries account for most of the complex sugars. The vegetables and bread contribute to the fiber content.

The total weight estimate takes into account all components of the meal, including the visible portion sizes. The presence of the coin helps in making a more accurate estimation of the plate size and consequently the portion sizes."
006.jpg,"Wholegrain bread, butter and coffee",314,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:02 08:08:07,15,40,12,18,3,250,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 15
- Complex sugars (g): 40
- Proteins (g): 12
- Fats (g): 18
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 250

Explanation: The meal consists of bread slices with butter or cheese, a small portion of what appears to be jam or honey, a cup of coffee, and a jar of dark liquid (possibly syrup or honey). Using the visible Swiss Franc coin as a reference, I estimated the portion sizes.

The bread provides the bulk of complex sugars and some protein. The butter/cheese contributes to the fat content. The jam/honey and the dark liquid in the jar account for most of the simple sugars. The coffee likely contains a small amount of simple sugar.

The meal is relatively low in dietary fiber, as there are no visible fruits or vegetables. The protein content is moderate, mainly from the bread and dairy. The fat content is significant due to the butter/cheese.

The total weight estimate considers the bread slices, toppings, and the liquid in the cup and jar. This appears to be a typical breakfast or light meal, with a balance tilted towards carbohydrates and fats, moderate in protein, and low in fiber."
007.jpg,Wholegrain bread with flaxseeds,183,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:02 11:25:46,1,25,3,1,2,60,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 1
- Complex sugars (g): 25
- Proteins (g): 3
- Fats (g): 1
- Dietary fibers (g): 2
- Weight (g): 60

Explanation: The image shows a small round bread roll on a white plate, with a 1 Swiss Franc coin for scale. Using the coin's known diameter of 23.22 mm as a reference, I estimate the bread roll to be about 7-8 cm in diameter. 

The bread appears to be a whole grain or multigrain variety, which accounts for the higher estimate of complex sugars and the presence of some dietary fiber. Bread typically contains small amounts of fat and protein, hence the low estimates for these nutrients.

The simple sugars estimate is low as there's no visible sugar coating or sweet additions. The complex sugars (starches) make up the bulk of the carbohydrates in the bread. 

The total weight estimate of 60g is based on the apparent size and density of a typical bread roll of this size. This is a relatively small portion, which explains the overall low nutrient amounts.

It's important to note that these are rough estimates based solely on visual assessment, and actual nutritional content can vary based on the specific recipe and ingredients used in the bread."
008.jpg,Farmer cerealbar and sinergy pills,420,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:02 17:53:17,20,25,2,1,0,50,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 20
- Complex sugars (g): 25
- Proteins (g): 2
- Fats (g): 1
- Dietary fibers (g): 0
- Weight (g): 50

Explanation: The image shows three yellow ""Farmer"" soft candy bars and one orange ""Synergy"" candy. Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, each candy bar appears to be about 10-12 grams. The ""Farmer"" bars likely contain mainly simple and complex sugars, being candy products. The ""Synergy"" candy might have slightly different composition but is also primarily sugar-based. 

The total weight is estimated at around 50 grams for all four pieces combined. The majority of this weight would be sugars, split between simple and complex based on typical candy compositions. There's likely minimal protein, fat, or fiber in these products.

The nutritional estimate is quite rough due to lack of detailed information about these specific candy products. The ladybug decorations and leaf illustrations are irrelevant to the nutritional content and were not factored into the estimation."
009.jpg,"Lasagne, wine and chocolate ",919,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:02 19:22:10,35,50,20,25,3,450,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 35
- Complex sugars (g): 50
- Proteins (g): 20
- Fats (g): 25
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 450

Explanation: The meal consists of a slice of pizza, what appears to be red wine in a glass, a bottle of Gletscher Vorau (likely a carbonated beverage), and four small pieces of chocolate. Using the Swiss Franc coin (visible in the bottom right) as a reference for scale:

The pizza slice looks to be a substantial portion, likely around 200-250g. It contributes to complex sugars (from the crust), proteins (from cheese and possible meat toppings), and fats. 

The red wine (assuming it's wine) doesn't contribute significantly to the sugar or calorie count. The Gletscher Vorau, if it's a sweetened beverage, would add to the simple sugar content.

The chocolate pieces, while small, are dense in fats and simple sugars.

There's very little visible fiber content, with the small amount coming from the pizza toppings and crust.

The total weight estimate accounts for all visible food and drink items. The nutritional breakdown is an educated guess based on typical compositions of these foods and the visible portions. The simple sugar content is elevated due to the likely sweetened beverage and chocolate, while complex sugars come primarily from the pizza crust. Proteins and fats are mainly from the pizza toppings and chocolate."

- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The meal consists of two slices of whole grain bread, butter, a small amount of cheese, coffee (likely with milk), a kiwi fruit, and what appears to be a jar of honey or jam. Using the Swiss Franc coin as a reference, I estimated the portion sizes.

The bread provides the bulk of complex sugars and some fiber. The butter and cheese contribute to the fat content. The kiwi fruit adds some simple sugars and dietary fiber. The coffee with milk adds a small amount of simple sugars and protein. The honey/jam jar, if used, would increase the simple sugar content, but I've assumed a moderate amount in this estimate.

The protein content comes mainly from the bread, cheese, and milk in the coffee. The total weight estimate considers all visible components, including the liquids. The meal appears to be a balanced breakfast, with a good mix of carbohydrates, fats, and some protein, though relatively low in vegetables and therefore dietary fiber."
011.jpg,"Couscous, watermelon and tomato salad and ham with bread",1193,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:03 11:51:25,15,40,35,25,8,450,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 15
- Complex sugars (g): 40
- Proteins (g): 35
- Fats (g): 25
- Dietary fibers (g): 8
- Weight (g): 450

Explanation: The meal consists of several components:

1. A package of what appears to be prosciutto or similar cured ham (high in protein and fat)
2. A container with cheese (likely mozzarella) and tomatoes in oil (protein, fat, and some fiber)
3. A container with couscous or quinoa and melon or peach chunks (complex carbs, some protein, and fiber)
4. A small dark bread roll (complex carbs and fiber)

The 1 Swiss Franc coin in the image helps gauge the portion sizes. The prosciutto package seems to be about 100g. The cheese and tomato dish might be around 150g, the grain and fruit mixture about 150g, and the bread roll about 50g.

The cured meat and cheese provide most of the protein and fat. The grain (couscous/quinoa) contributes to complex sugars and some protein. The fruit adds simple sugars and fiber. The bread adds more complex carbs and fiber.

This meal is relatively balanced, with a good mix of proteins, complex carbs, and some fruits and vegetables. It's moderate in fats due to the cured meat and cheese. The simple sugar content is relatively low, mainly coming from the fruit."
012.jpg,Chocolate and coffee,356,Unbalance,Medium quality,2014:10:03 14:38:07,35,20,8,15,3,150,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 35
- Complex sugars (g): 20
- Proteins (g): 8
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 150

Explanation: The image shows a portion of chocolate (about 4-5 squares) and what appears to be a cup of coffee or espresso. Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I can estimate the portion sizes more accurately.

The chocolate is the primary source of simple sugars, fats, and some proteins. Milk chocolate typically contains about 50-60% sugar, 30% fat, and 5-10% protein. The coffee contributes minimal calories but adds some complex carbohydrates.

The chocolate portion looks to be around 40-50 grams. The coffee appears to be a standard espresso shot (30-50 ml).

The simple sugars come mainly from the chocolate. The complex sugars are estimated from both the chocolate and coffee. Proteins and fats are primarily from the chocolate, with milk in the coffee potentially adding a small amount. Dietary fibers are minimal but present in small amounts in both chocolate and coffee.

The total weight includes both the chocolate and the liquid coffee. This estimate is relatively low in dietary fiber as neither chocolate nor coffee are significant sources of fiber."
013.jpg,Sinergy pills and olive crackers,303,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:03 17:12:34,1,15,2,1,1,25,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 1
- Complex sugars (g): 15
- Proteins (g): 2
- Fats (g): 1
- Dietary fibers (g): 1
- Weight (g): 25

Explanation: The image shows a square cracker or flatbread, likely a whole grain or multi-seed variety, along with three white pills and a 1 Swiss Franc coin for scale. Using the coin's known diameter of 23.22 mm as reference, I estimate the cracker to be about 5-6 cm square. 

The cracker appears to be the main food item and likely contains mostly complex carbohydrates from grains. It may have a small amount of fat and protein from seeds or nuts mixed in. The fiber content is likely low but present due to the whole grain nature.

The pills are not considered in the nutritional estimate as they are likely medication or supplements, not food.

Given the small size of the cracker and its composition, the overall weight and nutritional content are quite low. The estimates reflect a small serving size of a relatively nutrient-dense item, with complex carbohydrates being the primary macronutrient.

This analysis is an approximation based on visual assessment and common nutritional knowledge of similar products. Actual values may vary depending on the specific ingredients and preparation method of the cracker."

Explanation: The meal consists of several components:

1. A cup of green soup (likely vegetable-based)
2. A small cup of clear liquid (possibly broth or water)
3. Slices of what appears to be prosciutto or ham
4. A sandwich or bread roll in a paper bag
5. A small pack of M&M's
6. A 1 Swiss Franc coin for scale

The presence of the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) helps estimate portion sizes. The soup and prosciutto provide some protein and fats. The bread contributes complex carbs and some fiber. The M&M's are the main source of simple sugars. The vegetable soup likely adds some fiber and complex carbs.

The prosciutto is the primary protein source, while also contributing to the fat content. The bread and M&M's make up most of the carbohydrates, with the M&M's providing simple sugars and the bread offering complex carbs. The overall fiber content is relatively low, mainly coming from the soup and possibly whole grain in the bread.

The total weight estimate considers all components, including liquids. This meal appears to be a moderate portion size, with a mix of nutrients but notably high in simple sugars due to the candy."

The 1 Swiss Franc coin visible in the image helps estimate the size of the plate and portion. The toast/sandwich appears to be about 4-5 times the diameter of the coin, suggesting it's a moderate portion. The carrot sticks are relatively small in comparison.

This meal is relatively balanced, with a moderate amount of complex carbohydrates from the bread, protein and fat from the cheese, and some vitamins and fiber from the carrots.
