001.jpg,Corn flakes and grapefruit juice,794,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:01 07:50:07,30,45,5,3,2,120,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 30
- Complex sugars (g): 45
- Proteins (g): 5
- Fats (g): 3
- Dietary fibers (g): 2
- Weight (g): 120

Explanation: The image shows a bowl of corn flakes cereal and a glass of what appears to be a fruit juice or smoothie. Using the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the bowl contains about 60-70g of cereal. Corn flakes are primarily complex carbohydrates with some added sugar. The drink looks to be about 250ml of fruit juice or smoothie, which would contribute significant simple sugars.

The cereal provides most of the complex sugars and a small amount of protein and fiber. The juice/smoothie contributes most of the simple sugars. There's likely a small amount of fat from the cereal. The total weight includes both the cereal and the drink.

This meal is high in carbohydrates, particularly from the cereal and the sugars in the drink. It's relatively low in protein, fat, and fiber. The nutrition could be improved by adding a protein source and choosing a whole grain cereal for more fiber."
002.jpg,Nestea and wrapped kebab,1160,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:01 12:10:03,35,40,20,15,3,350,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 35
- Complex sugars (g): 40
- Proteins (g): 20
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 3
- Weight (g): 350

Explanation: The image shows a wrapped sandwich (likely a wrap or burrito) and a bottled drink, presumably an iced tea. Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the wrap to be about 20-25 cm long and the drink around 500 ml.

The wrap appears to contain some leafy greens (visible at the end) and likely meat or protein filling, contributing to the protein and fiber content. The tortilla provides complex carbohydrates. The iced tea is likely sweetened, accounting for a significant portion of the simple sugars.

The fat content is estimated based on potential dressings or cheese in the wrap. The overall weight takes into account both the solid food and the liquid drink. The nutritional breakdown is an approximation based on typical ingredients for such a meal, adjusted for the estimated size using the coin as a scale reference. This meal appears to be a moderately balanced option with a mix of macronutrients, though relatively high in sugars due to the sweetened drink."
003.jpg,Roast beef sandwich ,1209,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:02 12:59:58,3,40,20,15,4,250,"Simple sugars (g): 3
Complex sugars (g): 40
Proteins (g): 20
Fats (g): 15
Dietary fibers (g): 4
Weight (g): 250
Explanation: The image shows a sandwich made with what appears to be a whole grain or multi-grain bread roll, filled with some meat (likely ham or turkey) and lettuce. Using the visible 1 Swiss Franc coin as a reference for scale, I estimate the sandwich to be approximately 15-18 cm in length. The bread provides the bulk of complex carbohydrates, while the meat contributes most of the protein. There's likely some fat from the meat and possibly a spread (though not visible). The lettuce adds a small amount of fiber. The simple sugars are minimal, mainly from the bread. The overall weight estimate accounts for the dense bread and fillings. This appears to be a relatively balanced meal with a good mix of macronutrients, though it's somewhat low in vegetables and thus dietary fiber."
004.jpg,Scramble eggs,556,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:02 20:32:29,2,12,15,10,1,150,"Based on the image provided, here's my nutritional estimate for the meal shown:

- Simple sugars (g): 2
- Complex sugars (g): 12
- Proteins (g): 15
- Fats (g): 10
- Dietary fibers (g): 1
- Weight (g): 150

Explanation: The image shows what appears to be scrambled eggs with some added ingredients, likely cheese and possibly some small pieces of meat (ham or bacon). Using the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) as a reference, I estimate the portion size to be relatively small, around 150g total.

Eggs are primarily protein and fat, with minimal carbohydrates. The yellowish color suggests the presence of cheese, which adds more protein and fat. If there's meat included, it would contribute additional protein and fat.

The complex sugars estimate accounts for any possible milk or cream used in the scrambling process, as well as potential trace amounts from any added vegetables (though none are clearly visible). The simple sugars and dietary fiber estimates are low, as this dish typically doesn't include significant sources of either.

This meal is primarily a protein and fat source, with moderate calorie density but relatively low in carbohydrates and fiber. The portion size appears modest, suitable for a light meal or part of a larger breakfast."
005.jpg,Roast chicken and potatoes,581,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:03 13:10:38,2,45,60,25,5,450,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 2
- Complex sugars (g): 45
- Proteins (g): 60
- Fats (g): 25
- Dietary fibers (g): 5
- Weight (g): 450

Explanation: The meal appears to be roasted chicken with potatoes. The 1 Swiss Franc coin in the image helps estimate the portion size. The chicken provides a significant amount of protein and some fat. The potatoes contribute complex carbohydrates (starches) and a small amount of fiber. There are minimal simple sugars visible, perhaps a small amount from any seasoning or natural sugars in the potatoes. The overall meal is protein-heavy with a moderate amount of complex carbohydrates. The total weight estimate considers the density of the chicken and potatoes. The lack of visible vegetables limits the fiber content. The cooking method (likely roasting) adds some fat, but it's not excessive. This meal would provide sustained energy due to its protein content and complex carbohydrates, with relatively low impact on blood sugar levels compared to meals high in simple sugars."
006.jpg,Lasagne and lettuce and tomato salad,477,Unbalance,Medium quality,2014:10:04 12:39:04,8,45,20,15,6,400,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimate of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 8
- Complex sugars (g): 45
- Proteins (g): 20
- Fats (g): 15
- Dietary fibers (g): 6
- Weight (g): 400

Explanation: The image shows a meal consisting of what appears to be a baked pasta dish (likely a pasta casserole or lasagna) and a side salad. The pasta dish is the main source of complex carbohydrates and proteins. It also contributes to the fat content due to the cheese topping. The salad, composed of greens and cherry tomatoes, provides dietary fiber and some simple sugars from the tomatoes.

The 1 Swiss Franc coin visible in the image helps estimate the portion sizes. The pasta dish seems to be a moderate portion, roughly 300-350g. The salad appears to be about 50-75g. 

The pasta, sauce, and cheese in the main dish contribute to the protein and fat content. The tomato sauce and any vegetables in the pasta dish, along with the salad, account for the dietary fiber. The simple sugars mainly come from the tomatoes in both the pasta sauce and the salad.

This meal appears to be a balanced combination of macronutrients, with a good amount of complex carbohydrates, moderate protein and fat, and a serving of vegetables for added nutrients and fiber."
007.jpg,Breaded fish with stewed eggplant and zuchinni and ketchup and cream,351,Unbalance,Low quality,2014:10:04 20:28:07,5,30,15,20,8,300,"Based on the image provided, here's my estimation of the nutritional content:

- Simple sugars (g): 5
- Complex sugars (g): 30
- Proteins (g): 15
- Fats (g): 20
- Dietary fibers (g): 8
- Weight (g): 300

Explanation: The meal consists of what appears to be breaded fish sticks or chicken fingers on a plate, alongside a plastic container with a vegetable salad. There's also a packet of what looks like a sauce (possibly ketchup or a dipping sauce) next to the breaded items.

The breaded items contribute significantly to the complex sugars (from the breading) and proteins (from the fish or chicken). They also add to the fat content due to the frying process. The salad in the container provides dietary fibers and some complex sugars from the vegetables.

The sauce packet would contribute a small amount of simple sugars. The overall meal seems relatively balanced, with a good mix of protein, carbs, and vegetables.

A Swiss Franc coin is visible in the image, which helps in estimating the portion sizes. The breaded items appear to be about 10-12 cm in length, and the salad container looks to hold about 250-300 ml.

Given these observations and the coin for scale, I've estimated the total weight of the meal to be around 300 grams. This accounts for the weight of the breaded items, the salad, and the sauce packet."
