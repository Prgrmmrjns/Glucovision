Across D1namo patients, simple sugars peak at 1.29±0.88 h, complex sugars at 2.91±1.11 h, fats at 2.49±1.38 h, proteins at 4.32±1.97 h, dietary fibers at 2.93±1.37 h, and insulin at 1.62±0.93 h. On AZT1D, carbohydrates peak at 1.74±1.50 h and insulin at 2.30±0.62 h. In AZT1D, improvement at 60 min correlates with Carbohydrates peak time h (r=-0.47, p=0.020). On AZT1D, insulin–carbohydrate peak alignment shows an association with improvement (r=0.49, p=0.015).
