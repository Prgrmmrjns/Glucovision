For D1namo at 60 minutes, fats produced the largest glucose modifications (-6.08 mg/dL at +50 g; +0.79 mg/dL at -50 g, total range 6.87 mg/dL). Simple Sugars resulted in +1.47 mg/dL at +50 g and -2.47 mg/dL at -50 g (total range 3.93 mg/dL). Proteins showed +2.35 mg/dL at +50 g and -1.55 mg/dL at -50 g (total range 3.90 mg/dL). For AZT1D, correction modifications produced -6.93 mg/dL at +50 units and +1.05 mg/dL at -50 units (total range 7.98 mg/dL). Carbohydrates resulted in +4.17 mg/dL at +50 g and -3.09 mg/dL at -50 g (total range 7.26 mg/dL). Individual patient responses showed considerable variability around the reported average values across both datasets.
