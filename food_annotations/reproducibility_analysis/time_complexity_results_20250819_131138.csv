The bread provides most of the complex sugars (15g from wheat flour). The cheese contributes protein (5g) and fats (5g). The yogurt adds to the protein content (5g) and simple sugars (10g from lactose). The bread also contributes some dietary fiber (1g)."
001,012.jpg,4.25285005569458,3065,138,3203,5,0,0,0,0,5,"The image shows a package of effervescent tablets, typically used for making flavored drinks. These tablets are primarily composed of simple sugars and contain negligible amounts of complex sugars, proteins, fats, and dietary fibers. The main nutritional content comes from the simple sugars used to sweeten the drink."
001,017.jpg,4.614686012268066,3065,241,3306,16,35,13,5,10,79,"The meal consists of two slices of bread, a sliced kiwi, a cup of coffee, and a container of yogurt. The bread provides most of the complex sugars (approximately 35g from wheat flour). The kiwi contributes dietary fibers (about 3g) and simple sugars (around 6g from natural fruit sugars). The yogurt adds protein (about 5g) and some simple sugars (around 10g from added sugars in flavored yogurt). The coffee likely contains minimal nutritional value. Overall, the bread also contributes some protein (about 8g) and dietary fibers (about 4g), while the yogurt may add a small amount of fats (around 3g)."
004,001.jpg,3.8608267307281494,1890,187,2077,4,15,2,5,10,36,"The meal consists of a mixed green salad with shredded carrots, a piece of bread, and a dressing. The bread provides most of the complex sugars (15g from wheat flour). The salad, including the greens and carrots, contributes to the dietary fiber content (10g). The dressing likely contains some fats (5g) and minimal protein (2g). The vegetables in the salad provide a small amount of simple sugars (4g). The overall meal is light and primarily plant-based, with moderate fiber content."
002,006.jpg,4.318781137466431,3780,226,4006,10,40,45,30,6,131,"The meal consists of a slice of tart with plums and a plate with mashed potatoes, ham, boiled eggs, cherry tomatoes, and sprouts. The tart likely contains complex sugars from the crust (estimated 25g) and some simple sugars from the plums (estimated 10g). The mashed potatoes contribute additional complex sugars (estimated 15g). The ham and eggs provide a significant amount of protein (estimated 30g from ham and 15g from eggs) and fats (estimated 20g from ham and 10g from eggs). The cherry tomatoes and sprouts contribute dietary fibers (estimated 6g)."
002,004.jpg,4.5261759757995605,3780,225,4005,8,30,15,5,12,70,"The meal consists of a stuffed eggplant with rice and tomato sauce, accompanied by a side salad of lettuce, tomatoes, and other greens. The eggplant and rice provide complex sugars (approximately 30g from starch in rice and some from the eggplant). The tomato sauce and salad contribute simple sugars (about 8g from natural sugars in tomatoes and greens). The rice and eggplant offer some protein (around 10g), while the salad adds additional protein (about 5g). The fats are minimal, likely from the cooking process (estimated at 5g). The salad and eggplant contribute dietary fibers (12g from the vegetables and greens)."
001,008.jpg,3.992103099822998,3065,201,3266,5,10,3,2,15,35,"The meal consists of a salad with mixed greens, shredded carrots, and tomatoes. The mixed greens and carrots provide dietary fibers (15g). The tomatoes and carrots contribute some simple sugars (5g). The salad likely contains minimal complex sugars (10g) from any added dressings or small amounts of starch in the vegetables. Proteins are minimal (3g) as the salad appears to be vegetable-based without visible protein sources like meat or cheese. Fats are also minimal (2g), likely from any dressing or natural fats in the vegetables."
001,006.jpg,3.7711009979248047,3065,164,3229,5,10,3,2,15,35,"The meal consists of a bowl of diced tomatoes and bell peppers. The tomatoes and bell peppers provide dietary fibers (15g) and some simple sugars (5g from natural fruit sugars). There is minimal complex sugar content (10g), likely from any accompanying dressing or seasoning. The meal contains low protein (3g) and minimal fats (2g), as it is primarily vegetable-based."
001,013.jpg,4.399856805801392,3092,183,3275,12,5,8,5,1,31,"This is a small container of lemon-flavored yogurt, approximately 150g in weight. Yogurt is primarily composed of proteins and simple sugars. The yogurt provides about 8g of protein and 12g of simple sugars (from lactose and added sugars). It contains minimal complex sugars (5g, possibly from stabilizers or added ingredients) and negligible dietary fiber (1g). The fat content is moderate, around 5g, typical for flavored yogurt."
