These tablets are primarily composed of simple sugars and contain negligible amounts of complex sugars, proteins, fats, and dietary fibers. The main nutritional content comes from the simple sugars used to sweeten the drink."
004,001.jpg,2.6886730194091797,1890,183,2073,2,15,5,5,10,37,"The meal consists of a mixed greens salad with shredded carrots, a piece of bread, and a creamy dressing. The bread provides most of the complex sugars (15g from wheat flour). The salad contributes dietary fibers (10g) from the greens and carrots. The dressing likely contains some fats (5g) and a small amount of protein (2g). The vegetables in the salad provide minimal simple sugars (2g). The bread also contributes some protein (3g)."
002,006.jpg,4.273778200149536,3780,223,4003,10,40,35,20,6,111,"The meal consists of a slice of tart with plums and a plate with mashed potatoes, ham, boiled eggs, cherry tomatoes, and microgreens. The tart likely contains complex sugars from the crust (estimated 25g) and some simple sugars from the plums (estimated 10g). The mashed potatoes contribute additional complex sugars (estimated 15g). The ham and eggs provide protein (estimated 25g from ham and 10g from eggs) and fats (estimated 15g from ham and 5g from eggs). The cherry tomatoes and microgreens contribute dietary fibers (estimated 6g)."
002,004.jpg,5.092422246932983,3780,233,4013,8,35,15,5,12,75,"The meal consists of a stuffed eggplant with rice and tomato sauce, accompanied by a side salad of lettuce, tomatoes, and other greens. The eggplant and rice provide most of the complex sugars (approximately 35g from starch in rice and eggplant). The tomato sauce and salad contribute to the simple sugars (about 8g from natural sugars in tomatoes and greens). The rice and eggplant also contribute some protein (around 10g), while the salad adds additional protein (about 5g from greens). The fats are minimal, likely from the cooking process (estimated at 5g). The salad and eggplant provide a significant amount of dietary fiber (12g from vegetables and greens)."
001,008.jpg,3.657526969909668,3065,185,3250,5,10,5,3,15,38,"The meal consists of a salad with mixed greens, shredded carrots, and tomatoes. The vegetables provide a significant amount of dietary fibers (15g). The carrots and tomatoes contribute some simple sugars (5g). There is minimal complex sugar content (10g), likely from any added dressings or minor starchy components. The protein content is low (5g), as the salad primarily consists of vegetables. The fat content is also low (3g), likely from any dressing or natural fats in the vegetables."
001,006.jpg,3.58778715133667,3065,173,3238,8,10,3,1,15,37,"The meal appears to be a bowl of diced tomatoes and bell peppers. Tomatoes and bell peppers are low in complex sugars (10g) but rich in dietary fibers (15g). They contain a moderate amount of simple sugars (8g) naturally present in the vegetables. Proteins are minimal (3g), and fats are negligible (1g) as this is a vegetable-based dish with no visible oils or added fats."
007,019.jpg,4.006327152252197,3780,161,3941,2,15,5,8,1,31,"The meal consists of a cheese cracker and a twisted cheese puff. The cracker and puff are primarily made of refined flour, contributing to complex sugars (15g). The cheese in both items provides protein (5g) and fats (8g). There is minimal dietary fiber (1g) as these are processed snacks. Simple sugars are low (2g), as these items are savory and not sweet."
001,013.jpg,3.586920976638794,3092,188,3280,15,10,8,3,1,37,"This is a small container of lemon-flavored yogurt, approximately 150g in size. Yogurt primarily contains simple sugars (15g from lactose and added sugars). It has a moderate amount of protein (8g from milk). The fat content is relatively low (3g). Complex sugars are minimal (10g, possibly from added stabilizers or thickeners). Dietary fibers are negligible (1g), as yogurt typically does not contain significant fiber unless fruit or other additives are included."
