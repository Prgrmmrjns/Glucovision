\subsection{Time Complexity Analysis of mLLM-based Macronutrient Estimations}
\label{sec:time_complexity}

To assess the computational requirements and practical feasibility of deploying mLLM-based macronutrient estimation in clinical settings, we conducted a time complexity analysis using 10 randomly selected meal images from the D1namo dataset. Each image was processed once using the Pixtral Large model with identical prompts and parameters.

The analysis revealed that macronutrient estimation requires an average of 3.8 ± 0.7 seconds per image, with processing times ranging from 2.7 to 5.1 seconds. Token usage averaged 3375 ± 643 tokens per estimation, with 3190 prompt tokens and 186 completion tokens.

These computational requirements demonstrate that mLLM-based macronutrient estimation is feasible for real-time clinical applications, with processing times well under the typical 5-minute window for postprandial glucose prediction. The consistent token usage patterns suggest predictable computational costs, enabling efficient resource allocation in clinical deployment scenarios.
